Created 9/1/2019
Written by:     Paul Klappa, Shawn Herrington
Purpose:        Process PX4 data logs into some kind of digestable chunk, 
                previously this script was making a bunch of plots, now it has
                been modified to do things a bit differently but the central
                idea is that we are processing a binary file into some kind of
                human readable format (csv in this case) then we are reducing
                the csv data somehow to be useful (first it was by generating
                a bunch of plots)
Changelog:
09/05/2019  Shawn Herrington
            Include code written by Paul Klappa to make lots of plot from PX4
            data
09/12/2019  Shawn Herrington
            Remove code written by Paul Klappa to make lots of plots,
            incorporate a function written by Shawn Herrington which takes all
            constituent csv files and puts them into a single csv (also
            a new directory)
09/13/2019  Shawn Herrington
            Add the other methods supplied by pyulog (params, info, messages)
            and put the output in text files.  We are not using this info
            anywhere yet but will be using in the future (especially the
            messages file)
9/21/2019   Simeon Karnes (comment edited by Shawn Herrington)
            Encapsulate calls to pyulog methods inside of an if statement for
            ease of enable/disable behavior when rerunning analysis on data
            which has already been converted
09/26/2019  Shawn Herrington
            Moved enable/disable flag to the top of the file for ease of access
07/08/2020  Thomas Cacy
            Replaced a line that changes the working dir so that it works and 
            will process all files in a dir. Added some lines so the program 
            can tell which files have been processed and ignore them. Removed 
            unecassary copying and moving of large files. Moved the creation of
            directories to the program that uses them to be consistent
