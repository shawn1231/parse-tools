Csv combiner and fixer for degradation analysis from pyulog for PX4

6/30/2020 Made basic functionality

7/10/2020 Combined with csv fixer document.

Adds functionality for proper naming structure. Copies name off of original ulg file, which should be renamed first
Adds functionality for putting in group and repitition so long as naming structure does not change
Moves combined data to a new folder so it does not need to be done manually

Adds a second file for the mean and stdev

7/13/2020 Creates a second analysis file for the magnetometer data along with its mean and stdev 
Typo fixes
FUTURE WORK: Only works for 1 file at a time currently, add functionality for multiple files



WARNING: ulg file MUST use proper naming structure or the new columns will be incorrect
"""


"""
README: This program is meant for a workflow where once somebody gets a PX4 log file off the cube it goes for immediate processing while the team gets the next drone ready to get logs off
Therefore, it is meant for folders empty of other csv files, as it does not check for specific csvs within the directory but every file in the directory.


The directory must be changed to the new folder in order to get the file. Please copy and paste the folder path to the ulg file you are looking to get csvs and analysis. This is found on line 49 of the code
