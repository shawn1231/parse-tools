Date:           09/12/2019
Purpose:        Combine data recorded at disparate rates into a master file
Purpose:        Developed on faux data and then modified to work specifically
                with PX4 data which has been converted using the pyulog utility
                (specically the ulog2csv module)
Notes:          Modified to remove gui interaction so that script can be called
                from higher level parser script, also converted to function
                for easy calling from parent script
Notes:          Fastest sampling time is calculated automatically, it is tested
                working but if conditions change and it stops working it would 
                be easier to just type in max freq by hand than to troubleshoot
                or modify, parts of the code containing the min freq nonsense
                have been noted
Notes:          Currently the output is saved to a directory which is created
                in order to avoid having the "results.csv" script read as input
                data if this script is run in a directory where it has already
                been run previously, this could be improved in future versions
                by specifically ignoring csv files that are output by this
                script when we build the list of csv files to crawl
Notes:          Currently only tested in Python 2.7; although, the print
                functions at the end which are just for convenience may be the
                only part that needs modification to run on Python 3
Notes:          When you run the script select the directory of interest (in
                most cases this will be Test_##\FlightData\).  The script will
                read in all constituent csv files (stored in FlightData) then
                process the timestamp and do some important operations on the
                df before resampling to the minimum frequency and writing the
                contents to a file called 'results.csv' in a directory called
                'combined' which will be created if it does not already exist
Notes:          The script does not need to be copied and pasted into the
                directory of interest, that is handled by the askdirectory() 
                function
Notes:          To change the files which are added to the master csv, modify 
                the keywords_in_wanted_files list. To change the columns which 
                are included in the master csv, modify the keywords_for_columns
                list.
Notes:          To make the ulog2csv converter work, install pyulog in the 
                iPython console. To run commands from the console, you might 
                need to preface it with '!' otherwise there will be a syntax
                error
    
Changelog:
07/10/2020 by Thomas Cacy
Changed how the programs move through directories so it cleans up after itself
and moved the making of a directory to the program that uses it to be fully 
contained

04/17/2020 by Thomas Cacy
Changed what files are read into the program so that it only read the files we 
want. Added some code to only take in the columns we want and obfuscate 
some data. Fixed the 'Time' column so it is in seconds not milliseconds

09/12/2019 by Shawn Herrington
Fixed some bozo mistakes on the index renaming on the resampled array.  Was
resuing the time_properformat var from the big_df var but that var was being
ffill-ed by the resample command and giving time values that made no sense,
found a method to extract the datetime index as an int and all is working now
